<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
</p>
Hi, my name is Marie, and Iâ€™m 35 years old in Korean ageâ€”though, letâ€™s just say Iâ€™m halfway to seventy.ðŸ¤£ Iâ€™m someone whoâ€™s always brimming with thoughts, ideas, and passions, which can sometimes feel a bit scattered. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve decided to focus on one of the things Iâ€™ve been wanting to do: learning web browser coding. As I dive into it, Iâ€™m working on organizing everything I love and dream about into my own little corner of the web.
