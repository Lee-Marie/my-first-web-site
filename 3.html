<h2>Future plan</h2>
<p>
</p>
For the future is to find a warm, beautiful home, meet a husband who feels like he belongs in that home, and have a child who takes after me. I want to raise that child as not just my family but also as my lifelong companionâ€”someone to share the things I love and treasure as we journey through life together.
